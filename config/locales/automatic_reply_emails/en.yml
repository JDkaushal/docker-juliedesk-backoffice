          Hello,

          I looked up your email address and I couldn't find it in the list of the executives I work with, nor as a guest in a meeting that I'm scheduling.

          If we work together and you want to add additional emails to your account, simply let me know from one of your email addresses I already know. I'll update your preferences promptly.

          If you would like to set up a meeting with one of the executives I work with, please CC them in your request email.

        Hi %{client_name},
        In the recipients list of the email below I see no email that I know about registered in the system to get in touch with me. So I'm not able to process it.

        1. If you put me in BCC, I'm sad to tell you that I can't reply or handle emails that way. Please put me in CC next time.

        2. If your think, I should have dealt with this email, please get in touch with the team ASAP at hello@juliedesk.com for them to help you setup in our system the email you used to contact me. Otherwise you can use my generic email address julie@juliedesk.com.

        3. If I was right ignoring this email, please delete me from the mailing list I received this email from to avoid receiving this warning again.

        Thanks for understanding,
